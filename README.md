# LinqOnSteroids
A small library which allows to share code snippets of Linq2Entity Snippet between queries.
This is a very early release. Most stuff should already work out of the box, but some bugs are to be asumed. Please send any problems with the library to me, I will update and fix it as soon as possible.

# Usage
TBD

# Mentions
This project is strongly influenced by [LinqKit](https://github.com/scottksmith95/LINQKit) but takes it a step further. Especially the concept and implementation of the ExpandableQuery is heavily influenced by LinqKit.
